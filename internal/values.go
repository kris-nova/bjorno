// TODO @kris-nova we should make this dynamic
//
// We have an opportunity here to make this a dynamic server
// and allow users to pass in their own Values struct and their
// own refresh methods.

// Values is the droid you are looking for.
//
// If this struct has data, it will interpolated
// at runtime using Go's text/template.
//
// Web development is hard.
type Values struct {
	Title  string
	Author string
	Beeps  string

// GetValues is the magic sauce for where we get our
// values from.
//
// Here we always quickly return as this will be
// pulling at runtime. The guarantee we have with
// any of these Values is "best effort".
//
// As we are waiting on data, if it's not there
// we simply don't return it.
//
// However we let it try to "catch up" concurrently
// in the hopes we get whatever it is we are looking for.
//
// Note: This is where the DoS attacks will kill us.
