# bjorno

Bjorno is a recursive HTTP web server. 

Bjorno serves static content, and also offers the following features. 

 - Easy way to build custom routes/endpoints on top of static content.
 - Easy way to interpolate static content at runtime.

### This is a bad idea

You should probably not use this unless your name is `Kris NÃ³va` or unless you just really love this idea.

There are better ways for building and serving dynamic content, this just works for me because of what I **enjoy** doing in my free time.
